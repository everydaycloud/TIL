# Install Postgres using Homebrew - you can specify the version 
After you do this it won't work just yet, because Postgres doesn't create a superuser as a default.
To create one type 

    createuser -s <desired username>

The -s tells it that it's a superuser (admin)
Then type 

    psql <desired username> 

to check that all is well. You may need to kill and restart your terminal to apply changes.
