# Optional chaining operator

      const name = patient?.legalName

  This operator checks whether the patient objects evaluates to anything that isn't null 
  or undefined (maybe there's a delay in getting them from the API or something else 
  checks whether they exist in the first place). ONLY if the left side of the experession 
  before the question mark evaluates to something the right hand side will be evaluated.
  If the left hand side is null or undefined, the name will be undefined. 

  This can also be used with nth items in arrays.

      function printMagicIndex(arr){
        console.log(arr?.[42]);
        }

      printMagicIndex([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); 
      // undefined
      But if the ?. wasn't used it would evaluate to an error.

# Nullish coalescing operator

      const egg = null ?? 'scrambled' // egg will = 'scrambled'
      const egg = 'poached' ?? 'scrambled' // egg will = 'poached'

  Here if the value on the left side of the operator is NOT null or undefined the 
  expression will evaluate to it. If it is null or undefined then the right hand value 
  is returned. This is a great way of setting up placeholders for while the value we 
  need is not available.
