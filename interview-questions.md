## Good interview questions

1. How do you ship? Release wall or incrementally
2. Do you have a CI/CD pipeline set up?
3. How much do you collaborate within the team and within the wider company?
4. How do you prioritise work?
5. What's your process for post-mortems? Blame or no-blame

### Evaluating more senior candidates

- Proof that they do stuff instead of just talking about it
- Figure out what they want
- They ask how the business works
- Senior don't want to manage people, but they will usually need to
- They need to want to solve users problems and not just advanced problems
- Their github shows that they love coding
